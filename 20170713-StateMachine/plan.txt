State Machine presentation

Simple state machine
Vending machine example
JKI State Machine -> vending machine?
comparison with case/event after main case as in N. Kirchner's video.

Notes on video:
- Initial examples are all for QSM/QDMH. We need to consider a simple state machine first
- States can be identified by enabling/disabling, resetting graphs, etc
- Queuing blindly doesn't  consider state
- The improved version in the video has Event Structure producer, and consumer with CS + CS->state CS -> dequeue 2nd queue (triggers)
- Trigger queue goes to EvStr and to the 2nd CS group in the consumer
- Action queue is dequeued by main CS in the consumer, the typical SM case structure
- The internal CS (3rd level down) sometimes uses Queue Status/Peek to check next action/state.
- Only the 'brain' section enqueues actions.
- The goal is to separate actions and triggers. ("Stateful flow and control vs muscles")
- "Actions only happen on transistions. A state is not an action"
- TLB prime?
- Ctrl-Shift-W shortcut for windows browser.
